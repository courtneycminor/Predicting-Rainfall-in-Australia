# Predicting-Rainfall-in-Australia
This notebook is based on an article I came across titled "Predictive Modelling â€“ Rain Prediction in Australia With Python" (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/predictive-modelling-rain-prediction-in-australia-with-python/). To help me better understand how Logistic Regression Models and Python libraries (NumPy, Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly) work, I used this article as a guided project outline.

I also included a Tree Map visualization of Australian cities with the highest amount of recorded weather conditions in my notebook. I thought this was an important factor to know when creating the Exploratory Data Analysis section of my notebook and, incase there was a correlation between Location and any of the Categorical and Numerical Features within this dataset. 

For now, this notebook is completed. However, I will update and improve my notebook on Australian Rainfall as I continue to learn more about Python and Machine Learning Models.
